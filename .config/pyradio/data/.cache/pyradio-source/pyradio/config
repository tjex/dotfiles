player = mpv, mplayer, vlc

# Default playlist
# This is the playlist to open if none is specified
# You can scecify full path to CSV file, or if the playlist is in the
# config directory, playlist name (filename without extension or
# playlist number (as reported by -ls command line option)

# This is the equivalent to the -p , --play command line parameter

# Value is 1..number of stations, "-1" or "False" means no auto play,
# "0" or "Random" means play a random station

# Desktop notifications
# If this option is enabled, a Desktop notification will be

# Connection timeout
# PyRadio will wait for this number of seconds to get a station/server
# message indicating that playback has actually started.

# Valid values: 5 - 60, 0 disables check
# Default value: 10

# Force http connections
# Most radio stations use plain old http protocol to broadcast, but
