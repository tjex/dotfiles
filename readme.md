# tjex's dotfiles

I track my dotfiles using a bare git repo.

[What is a bare repo?](https://www.saintsjd.com/2011/01/what-is-a-bare-git-repository/)

[This article](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) goes into depth
about this technique of tracking dotfiles with a bare repo.

I've also written [dotf](https://git.sr.ht/~tjex/dotf), a CLI tool to make this
process quicker, easier and safer.

My neovim conf is a submodule, and accessible on
[Sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~tjex/nvim).

Certain other configs I keep as private submodules, mainly so as not to expose
my various emails to the internet.
